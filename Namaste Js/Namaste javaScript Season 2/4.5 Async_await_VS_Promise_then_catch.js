// Async/Await   VS   Promise.then/catch

/*
what should we use

- async/await is just the "syntactic sugar" over the .then() and catch().
    =>what it means is; when we use async/await js behind the scenes using its own .then() & .catch() only.
        so basically the only effect which is happening is heppening in the code how you write.
        js will treat your program exatly how it would tret with older approach.


 what is better async/await or then().catch() ??
=> both of them are better.
    async/await is a new way of writing code.
    -in async/await we don't have to do promise chaining. like we don;t have to deal with lots of callbacks.

    its a personal choice what to use.
